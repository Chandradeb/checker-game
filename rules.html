<li>The opponent with the darker pieces moves first.</li> <br>
<li>Pieces may only move one diagonal space forward (towards their opponents pieces) in the
beginning of the game.</li><br>
<li>Pieces must stay on the dark squares.</li><br>
<li>To capture an opposing piece,"jump" over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the direction of
the the opposing piece.</li><br>
<li>A piece may jump forward over an opponent's pieces in multiple parts of the board to capture
them.</li><br>
<li>Keep in mind, the space on the other side of your opponentâ€™s piece must be empty for you to
capture it.</li><br>
<li>If your piece reaches the last row on your opponent's side, you may re-take one of your captured
pieces and "crown"the piece that made it to the Kings Row. Thereby making it a "King Piece."</li><br>
<li>King pieces may still only move one space at a time during a non-capturing move. However,
when capturing an opponent's piece(s) it may move diagonally forward or backwards.
There is no limit to how many king pieces a player may have.</li>
</ul>
